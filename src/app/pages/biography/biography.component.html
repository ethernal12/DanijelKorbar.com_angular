  <p>2004-2006 Keko Varicon
    Final controle technician

    My job entailed conducting final stress test for varistors, which are used to protect against excessive transient voltages. While working there I had my first real world encounter with programming in the form of the Excel`s macros. After doing the before mentioned stress tests I had to fill out a lenghty report every time a specific test was conducted. As my work load got heavier I was looking for a way to expedite my work, so I resorted to study how Excel macros are recorded so my work flow would be accelerated and be more precise. After seeing how much easier and hassle-free my work was from that point on I really appriciated the automation aspect of programming and it`s real world applications.

    Line maintenance technician / night shift leader

    My job entailed maintaining the uninterrupted line process of INVASIVE BLOOD PRESSURE MEASUREMENT devices. At that job I learned the importance of communication with co-workers especially working in the night shift where sometimes tensions got a little high and it was crucial to keep workers motivated and concentrated so the process line was not effected.
